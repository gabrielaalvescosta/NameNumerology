# NameNumerology
A name numerology calculator made with Pure JavaScript (vanilla JS), CSS, and HTML. I made a numerology calculator that can calculate 3 numbers: destiny number (vogals and consoants), soul number (only vogals) and personality number (only consoants). You need write your complete name to see all numbers. All responses are mocked in numerologyData object in data.js, so you need app.js and data.js files to run the app.
